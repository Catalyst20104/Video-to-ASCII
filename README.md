# Project Description: Video to ASCII Conversion in C++
# Overview:
This project is a C++ implementation that converts video files into ASCII art using the OpenCV library. The project is developed on an Ubuntu system, with Vim serving as the primary text editor for writing and editing the C++ code. The project demonstrates how to process video frames, map pixel intensities to ASCII characters, and output the results as text or display them directly in the terminal.

# Key Components
1. Video File Input:
- The program uses OpenCVâ€™s cv::VideoCapture class to read video files in various formats (e.g., MP4, AVI).
- Each frame of the video is captured and processed individually for conversion to ASCII art.
  
2. Frame Processing:
- Frames are resized to a lower resolution to match the character dimensions typically used in ASCII art.
- The frames are then converted to grayscale, simplifying the color data to intensity values that can be mapped to ASCII characters.
3. ASCII Mapping:
- A predefined set of ASCII characters (e.g., @, #, S, %, ?, *, +, ;, :) is used to represent different levels of pixel intensity. Darker pixels correspond to denser characters, while lighter pixels correspond to sparser characters.

4. Output:
- The ASCII art can be displayed in the terminal, saved as a text file, or output frame-by-frame to create an ASCII-based video.
5. Editing and Scripting with Vim:

- Vim is used for writing and editing the C++ source files.
- Vim scripting and shell commands are utilized for automating tasks like compiling the program, processing multiple video files, and adjusting parameters such as frame size and character sets.

6. Platform:

- The project is designed to run on Ubuntu, leveraging its terminal for output and its package management system for installing necessary libraries such as OpenCV.
# Prerequisites:
- C++ Compiler: GCC or any compatible C++ compiler.
- OpenCV: For video capture and processing.
- Vim: For editing C++ source code.
- Ubuntu: The operating system used for development and execution.
# Usage:
1.Install Dependencies:
- Ensure that OpenCV is installed on your Ubuntu system. The project can be compiled using a standard C++ compiler like GCC.
2.Compile the Program:
- Use the terminal to compile the C++ code.
- Example: g++ -o a.out main.cpp $(pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4)
3.Run the Program:
-Execute the compiled program from the terminal, passing the path to the video file as an argument.
-Example: ./a.out sample.mp4
4.View the Output:
-The ASCII art can be viewed directly in the terminal or saved to a text file for each frame.
